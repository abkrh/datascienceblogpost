# Introduction #

This is blog as part of my in Udacity DataScience nanao degree. This blogpost documents the process and outcome of applying the CRISP-DM 
process to answer bsuiness questions. 

The data set used is the **Stack Overflow Data - 2017 Survey** that was provided with the course material. I came up with four business 
question I wanted to answer from the dataset. These questions are:

### Questions of Interest ###

- Q1. What are the most popular languages by country
- Q2. Is there a correlation between most popular languages choice and job satisfaction
- Q3. How does parent's highest education relate to highest respondent education
- Q4. Does remote work increase need for StackoverFlow? 

## Get the data, check the data, and clear the way

The first step is getting the data. But before we do that - it is relevant to state the tools we will be using for the data analysis. 
I worked with Python in a Jupyter Notebook and Pandas & Matplotlib. 

The data was already provided in a cvs format; this make the data acollection step, not required. The files were moved to the relevant 
folders Pandas read_csv was used to import the data.
