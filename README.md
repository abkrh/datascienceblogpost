Juptynoteboks and python are required to trun the code locally. See licensing section below for access to the data.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

My motivation for this projet is learning data-scince through the Undacity Data Science nanodegree. The data set used is the **Stack Overflow Data - 2017 Survey** that was provided with the course material. I came up with four business 
question I wanted to answer from the dataset. These questions are:

- Q1. What are the most popular languages by country
- Q2. Is there a correlation between most popular languages choice and job satisfaction
- Q3. How does parent's highest education relate to highest respondent education
- Q4. Does remote work increase need for StackoverFlow? 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

THere are only three main files in this repo - this ReadMe file, the jupyter notebook and the blog-post. All other files are supportive of these three..
